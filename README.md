# AdventureWorks Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the **AdventureWorks dataset** using **Power BI**. The goal was to transform raw data into actionable insights by building an interactive dashboard that highlights key business metrics such as revenue trends, top-selling products, and customer segmentation.

## Steps Followed

### 1. Data Understanding
- Explored the dataset to understand its structure, including tables, columns, and relationships.
- Identified key business questions to guide the analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected inconsistencies.
- Ensured data quality and accuracy for reliable analysis.

### 3. Data Preparation
- Transformed raw data into a clean, analysis-ready format.
- Created calculated columns and measures to support the analysis.

### 4. Data Modeling
- Designed a **Galaxy Schema (Fact Constellation Schema)** to connect multiple fact tables (e.g., Sales, Orders) with shared dimension tables (e.g., Products, Customers, Dates).
- Established relationships between tables to enable efficient analysis.

### 5. Data Merging
- Combined relevant tables to create a unified dataset for analysis.
- Ensured data integrity during the merging process.

### 6. Dashboard Creation
- Built an interactive and user-friendly dashboard in **Power BI**.
- Visualized key insights such as:
  - **Top-Selling Products**
  - **Revenue Trends**
  - **Customer Segmentation**
  - **Return Rates**

## Key Insights
- **Top-Selling Products**: Identified the best-performing products, such as the **Water Bottle - 30 oz**.
- **Revenue Growth**: Analyzed monthly and weekly revenue trends, showing a **3.31% increase** in the latest month.
- **Customer Insights**: Segmented customers by income level and occupation, highlighting high-income urban customers as a key demographic.
- **Return Analysis**: Tracked return rates to identify areas for improvement in product quality or customer service.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For data modeling, analysis, and visualization.
- **Excel**: For initial data exploration and cleaning.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated columns and measures.

## Project Impact
This project demonstrates the power of data analysis and visualization in driving business decisions. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, the dashboard provides a clear and intuitive way to understand business performance and identify growth opportunities.
